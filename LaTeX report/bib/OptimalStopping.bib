	abstract = { The application of existing desktop geographical information systems (GIS) to the assessment of accessibility by public transport has been investigated. Two approaches to the measurement of accessibility aggregate accessibility measures and the space-time geography framework are described. It is suggested that isochrones (lines of equal travel time) are a natural way to combine these approaches in a GIS setting. A desktop GIS application has been developed which can automatically generate isochrones for travel by public transport. The application successfully copes with the complexity of the public transport of a large city (Glasgow), comprising bus, rail, and underground services. Journeys may include an initial walk to a public transport stop, several interchanges between services of the same or different modes, and a final walk. Options provide for plotting isochrones for journeys by bus only or train only; and for exact or approximate isochrones, the latter generated more quickly. The application is described in some detail, and assessed. Sample outputs are presented, including an example involving further processing of isochrones to produce a constrained accessibility map, which demonstrates the generality of this approach. }

@article{Chang1991,
	abstract = {Analytic models are developed for optimizing bus services with time dependence and elasticity in their demand characteristics. Some supply parameters, i.e. vehicle operating costs and speeds are also allowed to vary over time. The multiple period models presented here allow some of the optimized system characteristics (e.g. route structure) to be fized at values representing the best compromise over different time periods, while other characteristics (e.g. service headways) may be optimized within each period. In a numerical example the demand is assumed to fluctuate over a daily cycle (e.g. peak, offpeak and night), although the same models can also be used for other cyclical or noncyclical demand variations over any number of periods. Models are formulated and compared for four types of conditions, which include steady fixed demand, cyclical fixed demand, steady equilibrium demand and cyclical equilibrium demand. When fixed demand is assumed, the optimization objective is minimum total system cost, including operator cost and user cost, while operator profit and social welfare are the objective functions maximized for equilibrium demand. The major results consist of closed form solutions for the route spacings, headways, fares and costs for optimized feeder bus services under various demand conditions. A comparison of the optimization results for the four cases is also presented. When demand and bus operating characteristics are allowed to vary over time, the optimal functions are quite similar to those for steady demand and supply conditions. The optimality of a constant ratio between the headway and route spacing, which is found at all demand densities if demand is steady, is also maintained with a multi-period adjustment factor in cyclical demand cases, either exactly or with a relatively negligible approximation. These models may be used to analyze and optimize fairly complex feeder or radial bus systems whose demand and supply characteristics may vary arbitrarily over time.},

	abstract = { The following is mostly a discussion of some issues relating to the design of minimum cost bus routes serving a multiple origin-multiple destination trip distribution. The main difficulty in determining any “optimal” routing originates from the fact that the objective function (total cost) is a nonconvex function of the assignment; the higher the demand for trips on a route, the better is the service that one can provide. One consequence of this is that a square grid of straight line bus routes is not likely to be an optimal geometry even under highly idealized conditions. “Good” geometries are more likely to focus routes onto a single street and past a common junction. }

	abstract = {Abstract In this paper, a model of a transit system is built in polar coordinates with radial transit lines in order to find the line positions and headways which minimize user (travel time) and transit agency (operating) costs in response to a general population density function. It is found that the optimum line location is related to the population density and the circumferential access. The optimum headway is found to be that which causes user waiting time cost to equal the operating cost. The simplification of a population density function varying only radially is introduced. A method for determining the optimum number of lines is developed. This number depends upon the ratio of the access cost to the sum of the waiting and operating costs. It is proven that, for optimality, lines should be located in the centers of corridors of uniform width and have equal headways. A fleet size constraint is also introduced for the simplified case. It is proven that for optimality, the fleet is divided equally between lines.}

A mode choice model is integrated into the iterative structure of the simulation framework, effectively combining mode choice, departure-time choice and route choice together with the traffic assignment in the simulation. This is in strong contrast to the way mode choice is handled in the four-step model traditionally used in transportation planning. The new mode choice model is mathematically validated on the basis of a simple test network, and then applied to a large-scale scenario. The support for additional modes of transportation is then refined, by implementing a detailed simulation of schedule-based transit into the existing car simulation. Was the first extension more on the level of the complete framework to support additional modes, is this extension on the level of the actual traffic simulation. The required changes and applied extensions are explained in detail, highlighting computational issues in order to increase the computational require ments only as much as needed. Illustrative examples are given, demonstrating the features of the integrated simulation, as well as a large-scale application showing the applicability of the integrated simulation in a large, urban context.},

	abstract = {Agent-based Transport Simulations look at individual travelers and simulate their movements through a transportation network. Currently, such simulations are either limited to a small region, or only support a single mode (usually private car traffic) for computational reasons. MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation) is such a tool that can handle large scenarios (e.g. up to whole Switzerland), but currently only simulates cars. This work describes how MATSim was extended to handle other transportation modes besides private car traffic, with a strong emphasis on transit. This includes not only the simulation of such traffic, but also the agents' mode choice decisions. The agents make use of a utility function to score their experiences with different transportation modes, which influences which mode they choose in following iterations of the simulation. This basically means that we no longer rely on existing mode choice models, e.g. known from the 4-step process. Instead, mode choice is iteratively adapted during the simulation (“traffic assignment” in the 4-step process). The combination of mode choice and traffic assignment leads to better results compared to a pre-calculated mode choice, as the results will show.},

abstract = {Public Transit Accessibility (PTA) analysis helps transit agencies and planners identify areas in need of transit service improvements and prioritize transit investments. To evaluate the accessibility of existing transit services and identify access gaps, it is critical to accurately estimate travel times between transit stops, which change throughout the day due to transit schedule variations. Commonly used methods in PTA ignore such temporal fluctuation. Moreover, these methods are unable to elucidate the causes of poor PTA. To address these issues, we first implemented an algorithm to effectively compute travel times at multiple departure times throughout the day in order to enable spatiotemporal PTA analysis. A series of indicators that are intuitive to interpret were developed to determine the varying causes of poor PTA and identify areas with immediate needs for improvements. We showcase the analytical framework using a transit network in the State of Utah operated by the Utah Transit Authority. The analysis is based solely on publicly-available open datasets, which makes it generally adaptable to other transit networks. Results can assist transit agencies with identifying areas in need of service improvement and prioritizing future investments.},

abstract = {The importance of ridership information has led transit properties to increase the amount of manually collected data or alternatively to introduce automated surveillance techniques. Naturally, the bus operators are expected to gain useful information for operations planning by obtaining more accurate passenger counts. This paper describes and analyzes several appropriate data collection approaches for the bus operator in order to set the bus frequencies/headways efficiently. Four different methods are presented to derive the bus frequency: two are based on point check (maximum load) data and two propose the use of ride check (load profile) data. A ride check provides more complete information than a point check, but at a greater cost, and there is a question as to whether the additional information gained justifies the expense. Based on available old profiles, the four methods provide the bus scheduler with adequate guidance in selecting the type of data collection procedure. In addition, the scheduler can evaluate the minimum expected bus runs when the load standard is released and avoid overcrowding (in an average sense) at the same time. Alternative timetables are also investigated in conjunction with minimizing the required bus runs and number of buses for a single route. In this way, the derived headways can be analyzed within an acceptable range while considering the possible changes incurred indirectly to the fleet size. The integration between resource saving and frequency determination procedures allows the scheduler's performance to be improved. ?? 1984.},

abstract = {The relationship between transport, poverty and social exclusion has increasingly held an important place in both research and policy agendas, particularly in industrialised countries. While this has helped consolidate an emerging body of theory concerned with the social consequences of mobility, our understanding of these dynamics in the context of high vulnerability and poverty in the Global South is still relatively undeveloped. Through the case of Soacha, a municipality adjacent to Colombia's capital, Bogot??, this paper explores travel strategies in a context of scarce provision of transport which, when combined with acute conditions of low-income and segregation, limit vulnerable populations' access to the city. The travel practices, perceptions and priorities of low-income populations in deprived areas of the Global South are analysed, using a framework of transport-related social exclusion, to critically examine the elements that play a role in gaining access to the city. The emergence of adaptable methods, relations and transactions between demand and supply that allows deprived populations to reduce their risk of becoming socially excluded show potential for conceptual and practical development in addressing and analysing transport-related social exclusion.},

abstract = {Connectivity plays a crucial role as agencies at the federal and state level focus on expanding the public transit system to meet the demands of a multimodal transportation system. Transit agencies have a need to explore mechanisms to improve connectivity by improving transit service. This requires a systemic approach to develop measures that can prioritize the allocation of funding to locations that provide greater connectivity, or in some cases direct funding towards underperforming areas. The concept of connectivity is well documented in social network literature and to some extent, transportation engineering literature. However, connectivity measures have limited capability to analyze multi-modal public transportation systems which are much more complex in nature than highway networks.In this paper, we propose measures to determine connectivity from a graph theoretical approach for all levels of transit service coverage integrating routes, schedules, socio-economic, demographic and spatial activity patterns. The objective of using connectivity as an indicator is to quantify and evaluate transit service in terms of prioritizing transit locations for funding; providing service delivery strategies, especially for areas with large multi-jurisdictional, multi-modal transit networks; providing an indicator of multi-level transit capacity for planning purposes; assessing the effectiveness and efficiency for node/stop prioritization; and making a user friendly tool to determine locations with highest connectivity while choosing transit as a mode of travel. An example problem shows how the graph theoretical approach can be used as a tool to incorporate transit specific variables in the indicator formulations and compares the advantage of the proposed approach compared to its previous counterparts. Then the proposed framework is applied to the comprehensive transit network in the Washington-Baltimore region. The proposed analysis offers reliable indicators that can be used as tools for determining the transit connectivity of a multimodal transportation network. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Based upon several studies analyzing the effects of public transit subsidies on a system's performance, there is a consensus that public transit subsidies have increased a system's effectiveness but compromized its efficiency and overall performance. In addition to providing an extensive review of recent work on this topic, the present analysis extends prior empirical research in two significant directions. First, this study controls for cross-section heterogeneity and autocorrelation that may otherwise seriously bias the resulting estimates and invalidate statistical tests. Second, in addition to examining the effect of subsidy by source (local, state, and federal), the paper statistically tests for differential subsidy effects by system size, a topic on which the literature has been surprisingly quiet. Based upon an analysis of panel data for fixed route public transit systems in Indiana, subsidies have no general effect on transit performance. Rather, transit system size significantly influences the effect that subsidies, both in total and disaggregated by source, have on performance. Further, a simulation analysis indicates that redistributing subsidies with no change in the total subsidy level will have little impact upon transit performance, a finding which may have important implications for evaluating alternative allocation schemes.},

abstract = {The results of statistical analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal public transport operating statistics from 16 countries aimed at identifying the relationships between subsidy, on the one hand, and fares, service, passengers, unit costs and output per employee on the other, are reported. This study updates earlier work carried out in 1979 for the European Conference of Ministers of Transport, and uses a greatly expanded data set covering 117 individual cities in 11 countries, and aggregate national data from 16 countries, over the period 1965–1982. The statistical correlations identified between year-on-year changes in subsidy and changes in a wide range of operating indicators show that the subsidy has reduced fares and increased the amount of service operated, and each extra 1{\%} of cost covered by subsidy probably attracts a 0.2 to 0.4{\%} increase in passengers. However, the study also finds highly significant relationships between increases in subsidy, on the one hand, and increases in unit costs and wages and reductions in output per employee, on the other. It seems that as much as one half of subsidy has been consumed by higher costs and time-lagged regressions suggest that, in part, the increases in unit cost tend to follow subsidy rather than precede it, giving some cause for concern that the uses of subsidy are not being controlled as tightly as they might.},

abstract = {Although the concept of social equity seems to be ubiquitous in most mobility plans of major Latin American cities, when evaluating transport projects for financing and prioritisation there are no specific or solid indicators to measure how they can contribute to promoting better access to opportunities, particularly for the most vulnerable segments of the population. In response, we designed a methodology that uses the concepts of accessibility and affordability as a complementary means for evaluating public transport investment, and identifying transport disadvantages and priorities for project generation. This is based on the calculation of accessibility levels to the labour market for different zones of a given city, by introducing a function of impedance composed by travel time budget and the percentage of income spent on transportation.The characteristics of time and percentage of income spent for accessing work obtained from transportation surveys define the "real accessibility" to employment for all the zones of a city. Then, a stated preference survey was applied in order to determine the desired expenditure in both variables, and the accessibility to jobs in this new situation was subsequently calculated. We calculated a third type of accessibility, using "standard" values of travel time and expenditure budget.This methodology is therefore used to evaluate different policies in Bogota, corresponding to changes in the fare structure of the existing public transport system, by proposing the development of cross subsidies, and carrying out an appraised on the impact of the development of a new Bus Rapid Transit line. The results show that depending on the population, its location and purchasing power, the impact of a redistributive fare with respect to accessibility to the labour market can be greater than the expansion and improvement of the public transport network. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In the United States, federal agencies are required to work towards providing equal access to resources for minority and low-income populations. Access to quality public transportation is critical for mobility to many of these populations. Determining how transit service is distributed among vulnerable groups has the potential to significantly enhance policy analysis. While many measures of accessibility exist, due to the complexity of transit networks and the scale of the urban areas, limited research has been conducted on developing a tool to measure how equitable the distribution of transit access is in a region. This paper develops a comprehensive method to quantify the quality of service and accessibility at each transit node in a network, combined with an index to measure the inequity (concentration of quality service) at the micro scale. These measures are applied to the distribution of all residential housing units, a random sampling of units and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development subsidized units in Baltimore, Maryland; to determine if the subsidized housing programs are achieving major policy objectives of providing equitable transit access to vulnerable groups. The results show that transit connectivity and accessibility is distributed among some types of subsidized housing units more equitably than can be achieved by random sampling in the general population, but for other types, the distribution is less equitable; indicating some policies to enhance transit access among these units have not been effective. Evidence from this study suggests that developers of affordable housing and transportation planners should work together to find development locations that place more emphasis on transit locations with high connectivity rather than simply reducing distance to any transit. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Although there have been many studies conducted that have measured access levels to public transport stops/stations, there has been limited research on measuring accessibility that integrates population density within geographical areas. This study develops a new measure that considers public transport service frequency and population density as an important distributional indicator. A public transport accessibility index (PTAI) is formulated for quantifying accessibility within local areas in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. A public transport network model is applied to identify the service coverage of public transport modes using a Geographical Information System (GIS). A consistent method is introduced for evaluating public transport accessibility for different levels of analysis, from single elements, including public mode stops to network analysis. The Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel and Activity (VISTA) is used to evaluate the index and examine the association between commuting trips undertaken by public transport and the level of accessibility within the Melbourne metropolitan region. Furthermore, the new index is compared with two existing approaches using the VISTA dataset. Key findings indicate that the PTAI had a stronger association whilst showing more use of public transport in areas with higher values of the PTAI.},

The problem of finding a set of travel plans which realizes a set of CDR trajectories and is consistent with a set of link volume counts is rephrased in terms of calibrating a choice model. This enables us to make use of an existing calibration scheme for agent-oriented simulations. We demonstrate our approach by an illustrative scenario with synthetic data.},

	abstract = {The introduction of electronic payment systems for public transport in many cities all over the world enabled collection of detailed and comprehensive data records of public transport journeys. Processing and mining of these data opens new opportunities in transport modelling and travel behaviour research. In particular its potential for identification and analysis of activities, which cause regular travels, represents a highly interesting research question. In this paper, opportunities for detection of primary activities, as home and work activities, and their locations based on records of smart card fare payment system for public transport are investigated. Thereby the city-state of Singapore is used as a case-study. In order to gain information about country specific activity characteristics and allow accurate model calibration, data from household travel survey is used. In particular, two major activity detection models are considered: a simple rule-based model using only activity duration for detection of work activities and more involved discrete choice modelling approach using additional variables as activity start-time and land-use information, and distinguishing between home, work and other activities. In particular, the benefit resulting from including land-use information into the discrete choice model is evaluated and models with and without it are compared. The developed models are applied to the full record of public transport journeys in Singapore and outcomes are compared against each other. In conclusion, challenges associated with analysis of longer time periods consisting out of journey data for several days are discussed.},

It is particularly focused on access to those opportunities that have the most impact on life-chances, such as work, learning and healthcare. People may not be able to access services as a result of social exclusion. For example, they may be restricted in their use of transport by low incomes, or because bus routes do not run to the right places. Age and disability can also stop people driving and using public transport. Problems with transport provision and the location of services can reinforce social exclusion. They prevent people from accessing key local services or activities, such as jobs, learning, healthcare, food shopping or leisure. Problems can vary by type of area (for example urban or rural) and for different groups of people, such as disabled people, older people or families with children. The effects of road traffic also disproportionately impact on socially excluded areas and individuals through pedestrian accidents, air pollution, noise and the effect on local communities of busy roads cutting through residential areas.},

Paratransit systems face many challenges that restrict how well they can serve their community, including limited funding, aging fleets, limited to no level of service standard assessments, and few practical modeling/planning practices. This paper discusses a transferable paratransit microsimulation patron accessibility analysis tool designed to address these challenges. The tool calculates paratransit patron accessibility (defined as paratransit patrons' perceived ease of access to reach desired activities and destinations) by simulating and measuring daily paratransit patron travel patterns based on service fleet and region information. The tool further allows providers to evaluate patron accessibility for any combination of population groups, travel purposes, and times of day. Transit providers can use the tool to determine how well paratransit patrons are served and the most efficient ways to improve service. The microsimulation framework, including the system of simulation models, the supporting data, and application to Brownsville, Texas are described in detail.},

However, these benefits are not always distributed equally among different population groups. This research seeks to determine whether the benefits of Toronto's public transit system are equitably distributed, and how these benefits change from 1996 to 2006 after the implementation of several transit projects in the region. We develop a methodology using a social indicator based on census tract level socio-economic characteristics to measure the relationship between social disadvantage and accessibility to jobs and transit travel time in the Toronto region over time. Transit equity is examined at three levels: spatially, temporally, and by job type. We find the range in accessibility and transit travel time narrows over the 10. year period. In addition, the most socially disadvantaged census tracts have statistically significantly better accessibility and lower transit travel times relative to the rest of the region in both 1996 and in 2006. Our findings show that Toronto has a generally equitable transit system that benefits those in social need, who are likely to gain the most from transit. The methodology proposed presents a useful way to bring issues of social equity directly into the land use and transportation planning process. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {One of the concerns that has aroused much scholarly attention in transport geography lately is the extent to which public transport provision enables the less privileged population segments, especially those without privately owned motorized vehicles, to participate in activities that are deemed normal within the society they live in. This study contributes to this line of inquiry by proposing a methodology for identifying public transit gaps, a mismatch between the socially driven demand for transit and the supply provided by transit agencies. The methodology draws on the latest accomplishments in the field of modeling time-continuous, schedule-based public transport accessibility. Accessibility levels to key destinations are calculated at regular time intervals, and synoptic metrics of these levels over various peak and off-peak time windows are computed for weekdays and weekends. As a result, a temporally reliable picture of accessibility by public transport is constructed. The obtained index of public transport provision is compared to a public transport needs index based on the spatial distribution of various socio-demographics, in order to highlight spatial mismatches between these two indices. The study area consists of Flanders, which is the northern, Dutch-speaking region of Belgium. The results indicate that mainly suburban areas are characterized by high public transport gaps. Due to the time-variability of public transport frequencies, these gaps differ over time.},

A further modification is the updating of route frequencies during route generation. The models were applied to the street network of Barcelona, Spain. Outputs were compared, and it was found that the new models produce bus networks with faster average travel speeds, smaller fleet size, fewer route kilometers, and fewer buses per link than previous methodologies.

The criterion for optimality is the minimum total cost, including supplier and user costs. Irregular and discrete demand distributions, which realistically represent geographic variations in demand, are considered in the proposed model. The optimal headway is derived analytically for an irregularly shaped service area without demand elasticity, with non-uniformly distributed demand density, and with a many-to-one travel pattern. Computer programs are designed to analyze numerical examples, which show that the combinatory type routing problem can be globally optimized. The improved computational efficiency of the near-optimal algorithm is demonstrated through numerical comparisons to an optimal solution obtained by the exhaustive search (ES) algorithm. The CPU time spent by each algorithm is also compared to demonstrate that the near-optimal algorithm converges to an acceptable solution significantly faster than the Es algorithm.},

abstract = {The public transport system of Santiago de Cali (Colombia) experienced several deficiencies in the last decade. Although it was used by about 70{\%} of the population and included 30 private operators of collective transport, who offered services for 233 routes utilising a variety of different vehicles, regulation was limited and often did not cover routes, stops, and frequencies. In 2009, the "Masivo Integrado de Occidente" (MIO), a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system came into operation, as a cost-effective transport alternative for urban mobility. This article examines the relationship between social exclusion and transport in Santiago de Cali and demonstrates that there is still room for improvement in aspects of spatial coverage and for a greater focus on the factors which explain the social need for transport which are not usually considered within planning. To this end, the theoretical framework for accessibility, social exclusion and provision of public transport is set out and the subject area of study is described. Later in the article an index of social transport needs is drawn up and another index, demonstrating the provision of public transport is presented in such a way as to highlight the difference between the two, expressing the spatial gap between need and supply. The results indicate that the BRT system can improve its services by implementing specific measures which take into account the socio-economic factors that largely explain the social transport needs of Santiago de Cali. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {U.S. public transit agencies struggle to attract and retain riders. Unprecedented public investments have been made over the past several decades for expanding and improving transit service across cities. Unfortunately, however, there is no evidence of increase in ridership once growth in population and aggregate travel demand are accounted for. Consequently, the quest for boosting patronage continues. The challenge, experts argue, is to attract people out of cars. In this paper, I use a recent state-wide travel survey from California and take advantage of a new comprehensive historical archive of regional real-time multi-modal transportation system data to explore contexts in which persons belonging to car-owning households within Los Angeles County use transit for their commute. I find that few car owners use transit, and that lack of access to the household vehicle(s) explain choice of transit to a large extent. While discretionary transit use (or transit use by choice) is rare, I find evidence that fast (relative to car), frequent and reliable transit service along with fewer transfer requirements strongly correlate with car-owners' transit mode choice. Home and workplace neighborhood density, proximity to transit stop, and availability of rail are other critical facilitators. Even if observed effects are due, in part, to self-selection, there are important lessons for transit planners. For example, results suggest that all else equal: reduction in transit-to-auto travel time ratio by unity can increase odds of transit mode choice by about 25{\%}; reduction in headway by 10 min can increase the odds by about 30{\%}, and; lowering the standard deviation of schedule deviation from over to under three minutes can result in 2.6 times increase in the odds. This paper identifies effective strategies for increasing transit's competitiveness relative to auto, and hence attracting people out of their cars. While rail network expansion programs and transit-oriented development efforts must continue across U.S. cities, it is important that planners also advocate for investments in key dimensions of bus service quality that patrons value, such as speed, frequency and reliability. Efficient network designs that reduce transfer requirements, introduction of bus rapid transit services, and improvements in real-time operations, scheduling and long-range planning by using ITS (intelligent transportation systems) infrastructures across modes are critical. This study shows that careful planning can promote discretionary transit use by attracting existing latent demand and by creating new demand in an era of increasing government interest in transit and growing traffic congestion. Broader positive effects on the travelling public and the environment are much greater than what this study can predict.},

This paper reviews the underlying ideas of how ICA emerged and its application to the engineering disciplines mainly on industrial engineering. The present study is the first ever comprehensive review on ICA, which indicates a statistically significant increase in the amount of published research on this metaheuristic algorithm, especially research addressing discrete optimization problems. Future research directions and trends are also described.},

More comprehensively considered passenger travel cost include bus waiting cost and accurate bus riding cost, transfer cost between buses and trains, rail riding cost. We present a new genetic algorithm which determines optimal feeder-bus operating frequency under strictly constraints condition. The numerical examples under passenger demand patterns of M-to-M are provided. It shows that the algorithm can provide reasonable results with satisfactory efficiency and passenger demand distributions have significant influence on feeder bus network construction.},

abstract = {A model is developed for jointly optimizing the characteristics of a rail transit route and its associated feeder bus routes in an urban corridor. The corridor demand characteristics are specified with irregular discrete distributions which can realistically represent geographic variations. The total cost (supplier plus user cost) of the integrated bus and rail network is minimized with an efficient iterative method that successively substitutes variable values obtained through classical analytic optimization. The optimized variables include rail line length, raii station spacings, bus headways, bus stop spacings, and bus route spacing. Computer programs are designed for optimization and sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity of the transit service characteristics to various travel time and cost parameters is discussed. Nurnencal examples are presented for integrated transit systems in which the rail and bus schedules may be coordinated},

The good is sold on the market and the agent uses the resulting money to buy many other goods. All agents have the goal to maximize their own utility, which consists of a positive contribution from consumption, and a negative contribution from work. The problem for the agent thus is to balance work and consumption. In contrast to many other economic models, this model prescribes the process in all completeness. The paper looks both at analytical solutions and at simulation results. A particularly important results is that a well-defined market only emerges when prices adapt on a much slower time scale than consumption. This makes clear that a functioning market does not just emerge by itself."

@article{Kaplan2014,
abstract = {This study proposes the assessment of equity in transit provision by using transit connectivity as a comprehensive impedance measure. Transit connectivity considers in-vehicle time, access/egress times, waiting time, service reliability, frequency, and 'seamless' transfers along multi-modal paths. In addition, transit connectivity weighs the impedance components according to their relative importance to travelers. The assessment of equity was performed for the multi-modal transit system in the Greater Copenhagen Area, renowned for its transit-oriented finger-plan. The assessment method used a GIS representation of the network (i.e., service lines, timetables, metro stations, train stations, and bus stops), and transit assignment results (i.e., level-of-service times, passenger flows). The assessment method proved effective in calculating location-based and potential-accessibility measures and Gini coefficients of inequality in the Greater Copenhagen Area. Results show that the transit-oriented development contributes to spatial equity with high connectivity in densely populated zones, vertical equity with comparable connectivity in high income and low income zones, inter-generational equity with good connectivity provision for students to higher-education and job opportunities. Also, results show that the north-west 'finger' is less equitable with lower connectivity for low population density and lower connectivity to higher-education opportunities regardless of the high number of students. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Litman2014,
	abstract = {Transportation affordability refers to the financial burden households bear in purchasing transportation services, particularly those required to access basic goods and activities (healthcare, shopping, school, work and social activities). This generally means that households spend less than 20{\%} of their budgets on transport, or less than 45{\%} on transport and housing combined. Several factors can affect affordability including people's travel demands, the quality and price of transport options, land use accessibility, and housing affordability. Surveys indicate that transport system users consider affordability an important planning objective, but conventional transport planning tends to give little consideration to affordability and considers a limited set of transportation costs and cost saving strategies. More comprehensive analysis can provide better guidance for incorporating affordability as a transport planning objective. Some transportation affordability strategies are economic transfers that shift costs to other economic sectors. Strategies that improve affordable modes (walking, cycling and public transport) tend to provide co-benefits and so tend to maximize overall benefits.},

These steps influence directly the quality of service through coverage and directness concerns but also the economic profitability of the system since operational costs are highly dependent on the network structure. We first exhibit the context and the goals of strategic and tactical transit planning. We then establish a terminology proposal in order to name sub-problems and thereby structure the review. Then, we propose a classification of 69 approaches dealing with the design, frequencies setting, timetabling of transit lines and their combinations. We provide a descriptive analysis of each work so as to highlight their main characteristics in the frame of a two-fold classification referencing both the problem tackled and the solution method used. Finally, we expose recent context evolutions and identify some trends for future research.

Tis paper presents a powerful new travel time- based method to visualize and analyze transit service coverage—a computer appli- cation called the Time-Based Transit Service Area Tool (TTSAT). Unlike other service area metrics, TTSAT incorporates total trip travel time into the transit service area maps it generates. To make these travel-time estimates realistic, TTSAT integrates all segments of a complete, door-to-door transit trip into the trip time calculations. TTSAT's mapping and analysis capabilities offer numerous potential applications for planners, developers, and members of the public working to create transit-accessible communities.},
